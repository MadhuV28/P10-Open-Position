# P10-Open-Position
In this program we will create a program to assist in managing a large number of applications for a job
listing. Upon filing, each application is given a score, and we only retain the applications of the current
highest-scoring N applicants.
To make this as easy as possible, we’ll be using an array-based min-heap to implement a priority queue.
The goals of this assignment include:
• reviewing the use of procedure oriented code (prerequisites for this course),
• practicing the use of control structures, custom static methods, and arrays in methods.
• practicing how to manage a non-ordered collection of data (a bag) which may contain
duplicates (multiple occurrences of the same element),
• learning how to approach an algorithm, and how to develop tests to demonstrate the
functionality of code, and familiarizing yourself with the CS300 grading tests.
The source code can be found inside the 'p10/src' directory.
